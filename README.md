```

---

## 🛠 Admin Login – Invalid Credentials Issue

If the frontend displays **"Invalid Credentials"** during login, follow these steps:

1. Visit this link in your browser to create the default admin user:  
   👉 [https://blog-application-gzkv.onrender.com/api/create-admin/](https://blog-application-gzkv.onrender.com/api/create-admin/)

2. The response will be either:
   - `{"message": "Test admin user created"}` – Admin user was created successfully.
   - `{"message": "Admin already exists"}` – Admin user already exists.

3. Once this is done, open the deployed frontend link:  
   👉 [https://684a77ffaffbb8b4dc4fd5b1--helpful-phoenix-7cc0bd.netlify.app/](https://684a77ffaffbb8b4dc4fd5b1--helpful-phoenix-7cc0bd.netlify.app/)

4. Log in using the default credentials:
   
 ```
Username: admin
Password: admin123
```
